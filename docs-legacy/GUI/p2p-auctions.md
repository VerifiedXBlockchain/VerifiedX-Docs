# P2P Auctions


## Overview

You can now publish auctions or self-hosted stores, both on-chain and to social media platforms, with asset collections broadcasted over the RBX network, by simply remitting 10 RBX on publishing, which is burned at the time of the transaction.

## Additional Info


All auction and store originators may also utilize a real-time chat feature directly with traders natively through the wallet, providing an elevated p2p commerce experience and a valuable tool when arranging for the transfer of tokenized physical or real-world assets between peers and/or the ability to seek additional information directly from issuers themselves. 

While the network activates true on-chain royalty enforcement for creators, the RBX native auction engine now enforces bid fulfillment and ‘buy now’ transactions automatically on-chain with complete transparent bid and transaction history. Each peer auction and store can be viewed by anyone with an RBX wallet and will auto-verify funds prior to participation. As previously known, all tokenized media and data associated with each NFT transfers automatically p2p at the completion of a transaction solving self-custody needs natively.

Lastly, third-party integration of the RBX engine is open to any authority providing on-chain solutions for royalty enforcement, self-executing smart contracts with built-in utility leveraging multi-asset and evolving features while also solving media transfer and ownership for issuer communities resulting in trustless engagement, transparent ownership, and increased user loyalty.
