# General FAQs

## 1. What is Reserveblock?

> RBX is a next-generation open-source layer 1 blockchain that is fully autonomous and decentralized with a finite purpose to democratize peer-to-peer operability and tokenization of digital and physical assets. Users can also mint & trade any RBX NFT created without the need for a marketplace. The network provides for true decentralized transfer of media tied to the NFT peer-to-peer, with a robust suite of on-chain tools and features through a core wallet. RBX NFT suite features have scalable utility that enable each creator complete autonomy and are self-executing. The network, being a smart contract-enabled blockchain, allows users the ability customize and control how NFTs evolve without the need to know how to code as well as provide on-chain royalty enforcement at the time of any transaction.

## 2. What is proof of assurance

> Proof of Assurance (PoA) is a system in which validators are agreed upon and a pool of them is created with those validators then each agreeing on the submission of blocks and the transactions inside them. Proof of Assurance is based on all validators agreeing to assure a specific amount of RBX and then honestly and accurately crafting transactions into blocks for the network and acting as beacons for p2p asset transfer.

## 3. How is the Reserveblock different from other L1 blockchains?

> RBX is different in that the network is NFT-centric, meaning the blockchain focuses on the delivery and features that allow for an NFT’s true utility and are not just a collectible but provides real & relevant functionality.

## 4. Do you need to own crypto to use rbx network?

> A user will need to have a small amount of RBX to mint or do a transaction at the nominal near zero fees or assure the minimum 12,000 RBX to become a node as a validator on the network and provide governance. RBX is also the network’s native currency.

## 5. Is there a desktop app for the rbx network?

> Yes, there is a core desktop wallet (CLI or GUI) where all functions are provided for a user.

## 6. Is there a mobile app for the rbx network?

> Yes. The RBX web wallet can perform many of the functions found on the core wallet. The Web wallet is a native RBX wallet accessible from any device that is connected to the internet, however it cannot validate, but it can perform every other function like the CLI and GUI.

## 7. Which cryptocurrency do you need to use to utilize the network?

> A user will need RBX native coins for transactions or to become an active node and utilize the tools and features found on the native wallet.

## 8. Can I send rbx coins to another person?

> Yes.

## 9. What does a “trustless system” mean?

> A trustless system is a system in which there is no centralized authority making decisions on your behalf. Therefore, you can use the system without worry of any third-party interference, friction or barriers and completely at will.

## 10. Who can write a smart contract?

> Anyone can write a smart contract through either the templated smart contracts provided without code or customized through the Trillum IDE.

## 10. Do users have the option to download their nfts into their personal storage without a fee?

> Yes, users can elect to store their NFTs and media entirely, the wallet can automatically zip and backup all NFT media related. The media preview can always be seen on the GUI wallet if the user chooses to keep the media active on the wallet’s internal folders.

## 11. What is the role of the discord community in the rbx network?

> The role of the discord community is to communicate with the RBX community and deliver useful information, provide support and updates, as well as provide for a friendly open forum for all to participate.

## 12. How is rbx a more environmentally friendly for nfts?

> There is no PoW for consensus meaning no heavy equipment or massive burden of power needed to secure the blockchain. Instead, validation occurs within the Masternode infrastructure where the client is operating a passive file in the background on any laptop, desktop, Raspberry-Pi etc (per the min standards), agnostic to operating system, which utilizes the existing power supply of the said device.

## 13. Will I need to remember a long private key to use the rbx network?

> The wallet will handle that, however like all blockchains when acting as your own repository, it is strongly recommended to follow best backup practices. The native wallet also provides an RBX domain name option to create an alias for your public keys. HD wallets are also available, but do require safe storage of a mnemonic recovery phrase.

## 14. What fees can I expect on the rbx network?

> RBX have near-zero fees for transactions and are fixed at **.00001** per kb. The network is gassless.

## 15. How do I become a member of the discord community on rbx?

> Simply click on the Discord icon on the site and agree to the rules and join. A user can also access the appropriate identified channels for network support.

## 16. Will the rbx network also be supported by developers?

> Yes, the network is open for developer participation. Additionally, as an open-source network, any developer can choose to make suggestions, create additional smart contracts for the compiler, or propose changes which can be voted on by active validators through the Validator Voting feature on the wallet. Devs can also decide to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the RBX network should they choose.

## 17. Will rbx provide a user with an online marketplace for nft exposure?

> Users have control over their own NFTs and where they can list them. There are in-wallet trading tools (p2p auctions), giving the NFT owner the ability to take their NFTs to any social or web-based platform they choose and conduct peer-to-peer auctions without any third-party or fees all through the RBX wallet. However, it is anticipated that existing and new marketplaces can pick up the protocol which then will allow for centralized trading should a user choose that option.

## 18. How do I register and what personal information is required?

> There is no registration or personal information required. Should any user wish to utilize the network, it’s features and / or become a validator, they simply download a wallet for their local environment and have the amount of native RBX coin to execute functions or the minimum required to become a validator and done. RBX wallets are non-custodial which means YOU are in control of your balance and what you do on the network, which again is completely at-will and open-source.

## 19. Can I buy and sell crypto on the platform?

> No, that can only be done through centralized or decentralized exchanges, however upon owning RBX native coin, you can hold them in your non-custodial wallet.

## 20. If I am a masternode can I vote for changes or improvements on the network?

> Yes, any active validator who has crafted at least one block may submit a topic for voting by all peers. Validators are the ones who govern the network and shape its future. Non-validators, such as developers, may introduce a proposal to the network through the community discord channel and engage with the community to lobby a node to sponsor a topic for submission on the network for voting. All topics are viewed real-time through the RBX core wallet as well as votes, with both completely on-chain, creating an archive.
