# What is RBX?

ReserveBlock RBX (ReserveBlock.IO) is an open-source p2p layer 1 blockchain built in C# that is fully autonomous, decentralized, and governed by validators through on-chain voting.  RBX was developed with a finite purpose, to democratize mining without the burdens and frictions of Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), but rather a liquid Proof of Assurance (PoA) consensus while earning randomized block rewards in a carbon neutral environment such as a laptop machine with at-will participation.  The network is gasless with no lockups or holding periods and gives zero weight to a user's balance.  The RBX network is also a complete self-management ecosystem that provides any user with on-chain tools and features to tokenize any digital or physical asset with native minting through self-executing NFT smart contracts (SENs).  RBX SENs can be deployed natively with peer-to-peer transferring of the underlying media and files associated with any NFT and through a non-custodial core-wallet without any third-party application.Â 

The ReserveBlock RBX protocol has built-in scalable utility features such as on-chain royalty enforcement, multi-asset and evolving / devolving NFTs, wrapping and pairing of assets, p2p media transfer, domain name service, and on-chain self-governance, in addition to others.  Developed with Bitcoin principles in mind and adhering to that ethos, has allowed the network to achieve an autonomous and decentralized ecosystem with specific utility-driven purposes agnostic to use-case or environment. Individuals can immediately interact with the network globally, devoid of any third-parties or without technical expertise with a built-in source code generator, while also enabling developers and integrators a simple way to build through open-source APIs and the programmable smart contract language Trillium.  

Peers may join the self-governing network as a validator with the minimum 12,000 RBX native coin balance required in their core-wallet, a machine (such as a laptop), and a unique IP address.  Validators, when active, are then eligible to craft blocks and validate transactions per the RBX consensus Proof of Assurance (PoA) algorithm and earn randomized block rewards. Validating is completely at-will, and any peer may join or stop validating at any time without any penalties, fees, or holding periods and with no preference to balance given, so long as the minimum requirements of RBX is maintained.  Each validator is eligible to submit topics for on-chain voting by peers through their respective core-wallets, with all peers eligible to cast their own votes in response on-chain.  Additionally and in its current state, all near-zero fees are immediately burned upon the transaction,  reducing both the circulating and finite lifetime supply of native coin, creating a deflationary feature that accelerates as network utilization increases.  Non-validators may use RBX native wallets to compile smart contracts, mint and deploy SENs, and utilize all on-chain features and tools, such as the RBX domain name service and native media transfer in the same gasless environment with or without any third-party as well.

The network aims to help solve current individual adoption challenges of blockchain technology by way of a simple interface that helps remove existing barriers to efficient self-sovereignty and self-custody while democratizing participation, governance, and management of assets through native tokenization with a YOUR Block, YOUR Data methodology.
