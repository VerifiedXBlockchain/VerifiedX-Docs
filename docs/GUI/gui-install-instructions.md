## Installing

Once downloaded (likely to your `Downloads` folder) you'll need to run the installer. The process is different between Windows and MacOS.

### Windows

1. Double click the installer file. If prompted with an `Unknown Publisher` window, click `Yes` or `Continue`. Note: this prompt varies depending on the version of your Windows. You may see a box that has a link reading `More Info`. If so, click that link to see a `Run Anyway` button. 

> If the installer doesn't launch at all, try right clicking on the icon and choose `Run as administrator`.

2. Follow the prompts by clicking `Next` followed by `Install`.

3. Once the progress bar finishes, you can click `Finish` to automatically run the wallet.

4. For subsequent launches of the wallet, you will find an icon on your desktop, start menu, and it can be ran from the installed location (`C:\Program Files (x86)\RBXWallet\RBXWallet.exe`).

> If you are having trouble running it, try right clicking on the icon and choose `Run as administrator`.

### MacOS

1. Double click the installer file which will open a window in the bottom left corner of your screen.

2. Drag the `RBXWallet` application into the `Applications` folder in the window.
