# CLI Build Instructions

The following instructions will cover building and running the VFX on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
The most important step is to install .net core 6.

For Linux you can find install instructions here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux. This document will cover how to install for Ubuntu.

In the last step for _dotnet ReserveBlockCore(.dll or .exe or blank)_ if that does not work you can also try _dotnet run ReserveBlockCore(.dll or .exe or blank)_

## Linux

Linux Install For Ubuntu 22.04:

1. wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
2. sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
3. rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
4. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-6.0
5. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-6.0
6. run `dotnet --version`. You should see a version number of 6.0.xxx
7. `mkdir vfx` - Makes a direction for VFX
8. cd vfx
9. a) Clone the repo with git. `git clone https://github.com/VerifiedXBlockchain/VerifiedX-Core.git`

   b) Download the already packaged release https://github.com/VerifiedXBlockchain/VerifiedX-Core/releases/. If you do this please navigate to folder you downloaded binaries from and skip to step 12.

8. `cd VerifiedX-Core`
9. `dotnet build` - There should be 0 (zero) errors.
10. `dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --output ./vfxpublished` \*\*please note the `linux-x64` can be changed if you are on a different architecture
11. `cd vfxpublished`
12. `dotnet ReserveBlockCore.dll`

You are done! You should now see a wallet running! Some common errors are usually related to file permissions. Please ensure you have given proper permission to the newly created VFX folder

### Dotnet Conflicts

If you see an error like this, it means your have a conflict with dotnet versions.

Then paste in the following and save/exit nano:
```
