- **VOTE**: Governance voting transactions

### NFT Subtypes

- **TOKEN_CREATE**: Creating fungible token

## Field Descriptions

### Basic Transaction Data
- `hash`: Unique transaction identifier
- `type`: Category of transaction
- `from_address`: Sender's VFX address
- `to_address`: Recipient's VFX address  
- `total_amount`: Amount transferred (excluding fees)
- `total_fee`: Transaction processing fee
- `timestamp`: When the transaction was created
- `height`: Block height containing this transaction
- `confirmations`: Number of blocks confirming this transaction
- `status`: Current transaction status

### Technical Details
- `size`: Transaction size in bytes
- `nonce`: Sequence number for sender's transactions
- `data`: Additional transaction data (for smart contracts)
- `signature`: Cryptographic signature proving authenticity
- `inputs`: Transaction inputs with amounts
- `outputs`: Transaction outputs and destinations

### Address Query Fields
- `direction`: Whether address was sender or recipient
- `counterparty_address`: The other party in the transaction
- `amount`: Amount relevant to the queried address
- `fee`: Fee paid (only for sent transactions)

## Transaction Status

- `pending`: Transaction submitted but not yet confirmed
- `confirmed`: Transaction included in a block
- `failed`: Transaction failed to execute properly
- `rejected`: Transaction rejected by network

## Notes

- All monetary amounts are returned as strings to preserve precision
- Confirmations increase as new blocks are added after the transaction
- Smart contract transactions may include additional data fields
- NFT transactions reference specific token identifiers
- Fee calculations depend on transaction complexity and network congestion
- Large result sets are paginated for performance
