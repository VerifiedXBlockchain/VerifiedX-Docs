# Web API: Metrics

The Metrics API provides endpoints for retrieving network statistics, performance metrics, and analytics data for the VFX blockchain.

## Base URL
```
/api/metrics/
```

## Endpoints

### Get Network Metrics
```http
GET /api/metrics/
```

Returns comprehensive network statistics and performance metrics.

**Query Parameters:**
- `period`: Time period for metrics ('24h', '7d', '30d', 'all') - default: '24h'
- `detailed`: Include detailed breakdowns (true/false) - default: false

**Response:**

## Notes

- All monetary values are in VFX tokens unless specified
- Percentages are calculated based on total counts for the specified period
- Geographic distribution is based on master node IP geolocation
- TPS (Transactions Per Second) includes all transaction types
- Market cap requires external price data integration
- Some metrics may have slight delays due to calculation complexity
