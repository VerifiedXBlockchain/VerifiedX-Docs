# Web API: Metrics

Network-level statistics. Three endpoint groups exist: `/api/metrics/` for chain totals and the current block time, `/api/network-metrics/` for block-cadence health, and `/api/circulation/` for the supply and burn figures used by the explorer and by supply trackers. All are `GET`, take no parameters, and are cached on the server for a few seconds.

## Network Metrics
```http
GET /api/metrics/
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "latest_block": 7233302,
  "active_validators": 96,
  "total_transactions": 893028,
  "total_burned": 2111.2838081813047,
  "circulating_supply": 199997888.71619183,
  "lifetime_supply": 199997888.71619183,
  "block_time": 12.523809523809524
}
```

**Fields:**
- `latest_block`: number of blocks indexed by the explorer, which tracks the current chain height
- `active_validators`: master nodes currently in the active validator set
- `total_transactions`: indexed transactions, excluding block-reward coinbase records
- `total_burned`: VFX burned to date: all transaction fees plus the amounts burned by domain registrations, shop registrations, and vault (reserve account) activations
- `circulating_supply`, `lifetime_supply`: 200,000,000 minus `total_burned`; both are the same figure because the supply is fixed and fully circulated
- `block_time`: average seconds between blocks over the last five minutes (`0` when fewer than two blocks fall in that window)

The `ordering`, `search`, `page`, and `limit` parameters shown for this endpoint in Swagger are ignored.

## Block Cadence
```http
GET /api/network-metrics/
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "block_difference_average": 12.5,
  "block_last_received": "2026-09-04T07:41:41Z",
  "block_last_delay": 22,
  "time_since_last_block": 10,
  "blocks_averages": "3456/3456"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `block_difference_average`: average interval between recent blocks, in seconds
- `block_last_received`: when the explorer's node received the last block
- `block_last_delay`: delay of the last block, in seconds
- `time_since_last_block`: seconds since the last block at the time of the request
- `blocks_averages`: a short text summary of block counts reported by the node's network information

Values refresh at most every 10 seconds.

## Circulation
```http
GET /api/circulation/
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "balance": 199997888.71619183,
  "lifetime_supply": 199997888.71619183,
  "fees_burned_sum": 2111.2838081813047,
  "fees_burned": 2111,
  "total_staked": 480000.0,
  "active_master_nodes": 96,
  "total_master_nodes": 19673,
  "total_addresses": 23902,
  "total_transactions": 893028,
  "cli_version": "5.0.1.xxx-beta"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `balance`: circulating supply in VFX
- `lifetime_supply`: total supply after burns (equal to `balance`)
- `fees_burned_sum`: exact VFX burned; `fees_burned`: the same figure as an integer
- `total_staked`: VFX assured by active validators (5,000 VFX per active validator)
- `active_master_nodes`, `total_master_nodes`: validators active now, and every validator address the explorer has recorded
- `total_addresses`: addresses known to the explorer
- `total_transactions`: indexed transactions
- `cli_version`: a static string in the current service; do not use it to detect the Core release

Values refresh at most every 30 seconds.

Two plain-text variants serve supply trackers:

```http
GET /api/circulation/circulating/
GET /api/circulation/lifetime/
```

Each returns the bare number, for example `199997888.71619183`.

## Notes

- Amounts are VFX as JSON numbers on these endpoints; most other endpoints return amounts as strings.
- There are no hash-rate, difficulty, fee-percentile, or per-hour breakdown fields: the network uses Proof of Assurance, not mining, and the API does not aggregate fees by time.
- Per-period metrics (24h, 7d, 30d) are not offered; compute them from the [Block](./block) and [Transaction](./transaction) endpoints.
