# Testnet

You can access testnet by running the CLI with the `testnet` flag.

Testnet database files are stored as a sibling file to your mainnet db files with the suffix `test`.

All ports are one digits longer, prefixed with a `1`.

Validating: `13338` & `13339`.
API: `17292`.

Thus, you would access swagger through this link: `http://localhost:17292/swagger`.

Please note that all testnet addresses begin with an `x` instead of an `R`.

Testnet Faucet: https://spyglass-testnet.verifiedx.io/faucet

For anything bitcoin related, VerifiedX uses [testnet4](https://mempool.space/testnet4) due to the 2024 time warp attack that crippled the testnet3 network.
