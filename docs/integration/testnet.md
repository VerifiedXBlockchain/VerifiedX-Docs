# Testnet

You can access testnet by running the CLI with the `testnet` flag.

Testnet database files are stored as a sibling file to your mainnet db files with the suffix `test`.

All ports are one digits longer, prefixed with a `1`.

Validating: `13338` & `13339`.
API: `17292`.

Thus, you would access swagger through this link: `http://localhost:17292/swagger`.
