The Transactions tab offers comprehensive tools to manage your accounts' activity:


- **Filter Options**: Sort transactions by type, address, or status.
- **Detailed View**: Inspect transaction details, including timestamps and confirmations.
- **Spyglass Integration**: Open transactions in the network explorer for deeper analysis.

### Transaction Components
- **Hash** - This is created by the wallet once a full TX is prepared. A hash consist of the follow pieces of information: `Timestamp + FromAddress + ToAddress + Amount + Fee + Nonce + TransactionType + Data`
- **ToAddress** - This is the VFX address in which the transaction is being sent to
- **FromAddress** - This is the VFX address in which the transaction is being sent from.
- **Amount** - This is the amount of VFX that is being sent in a transaction
- **Nonce** - This is the transaction counter for a given address. As transactions are sent this counter is increased by 1
- **Fee** - This is the near zero atomic fee that is associated with a transaction and is calculated through the wallet.
- **Timestamp** - This is a unix timestamp in seconds
- **Data** - This is the associated tx data for when a transaction is more than just a basic transfer of VFX (ex: NFTs, ADNRs, etc.). This will be _null_ if performing a basic VFX tx.
- **Signature** - This is an ECDSA Signature where the message is always the Hash of the transaction.
- **Height** - This is the block height a TX is associated with once crafted.
- **TransactionType** - The type of transaction.
- **TransactionStatus** - Pending, Success, Fail
