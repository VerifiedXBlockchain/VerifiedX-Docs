### Overview
Vault Accounts act as secure, on-chain storage with features like:
- **Time-Locked Transactions**: Delay fund transfers until a specified date and time.
- **Trustless Escrow**: Conduct secure, conditional transactions without intermediaries.
- **Recovery Options**: Instantly recover assets in the event of breaches or errors.

### Setting Up a Vault Account
1. **Create a Password**:
   - This password encrypts your vault account data. Without it, you cannot perform transactions.
   - Store the password securely as it is not included in backups.
2. **Backup Your Data**:
   - Use the “Copy All” button or “Save as File” to create a backup of your vault data.
   - Keep this backup in a secure, offline location.
3. **Fund Your Vault**:
   - Deposit a minimum of 5 VFX to initialize the account.
   - Transactions to activate the vault will burn 4 VFX.
4. **Activate Your Vault**:
   - Activation can be done immediately after funding or at a later time.
   - Once activated, your vault is ready to send and receive funds.

### Time-Locked Transactions
- **Set a Lock Period**:
   - Specify a time (minimum 24 hours) before funds are released to the recipient.
   - Transactions can be canceled during this period.

### Recovery Process
1. **Trigger Recovery**:
   - Use the one-click recovery feature in case of compromise.
   - All funds and assets are transferred to your recovery address.
2. **Recovery Address**:
   - This address is generated during setup and is only known to you.
