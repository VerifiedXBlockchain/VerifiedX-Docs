To become a validator on the VerifiedX network, you’ll need:

- 50,000 VFX (fully liquid and usable anytime).
- A machine meeting the standard specs, with a static IP address. 
- Three open ports for network connectivity. (`3338` & `3339`, & `7294` )

Your VFX remains liquid, meaning you can turn off your validator at any time and instantly transact with your funds without holding periods, without fees, and without penalties.

Unlike traditional mining or staking, validators do not earn block rewards. Instead, they play a pivotal role in on-chain governance.

Each validator you run grants you one vote on network proposals, changes, and enhancements, creating a truly decentralized governing body with a one CPU one vote methodology, where validators collectively shape the future of the network. This is all accomplished with real-time ‘one-click’ actions and visuals in the wallets.
