# First Launch

When you launch VerifiedX Switchblade for the first time, follow these steps to ensure a smooth start:

1. **Snapshot Import**:
   - A prompt will guide you to import a snapshot of the blockchain.
   - Click “Import” and select the snapshot file from your system.
   - This process significantly reduces the time required to sync the blockchain.
2. **CLI Restart**:
   - After importing the snapshot, the Command Line Interface (CLI) will restart automatically.
   - Let the application complete this process without interruption.
3. **Sync Completion**:
   - Allow the wallet to finish syncing with the blockchain. Depending on your internet connection, this may take several minutes.
