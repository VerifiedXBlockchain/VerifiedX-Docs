# GUI Wallet FAQs

### 1. How do I create and activate the RBX wallet?

> After downloading the wallet, you will be prompted to create a new wallet or import a previously created key. The new wallet creation will provide the private key and public address, which can be copied and stored safely.

### 2. How can I access the private key on my wallet?

> The private key can be accessed in the Manage Wallet screen, this screen can be reached by clicking on the drop-down menu next to your public address in the top header of the wallet.

### 3. How to find my Receiving Address?

> After creating or importing a private key, the public address will automatically generate and can be seen on the top header of the wallet.

### 4. Can I import/create multiple accounts on the same wallet?

> You may import/create multiple accounts on the same wallet, but many functions such as Validating and Smart Contract media retrieval should only be done with one address on one wallet. Managing multiple accounts on the same wallet is not advised.

### 5. How do I switch accounts on my wallet?

> To switch between multiple accounts on the same wallet, click on the drop-down menu next to the public address on the top header of the wallet.

### 6. How do I send RBX coins from my wallet?

> To send RBX coins, you will need the recipient’s address or the RBX domain name registered to the receivers address which will be entered on the corresponding field on the ‘Send RBX page’.

### 7. Can I use the same wallet to send/receive transactions between accounts?

> Yes, if you know which account is active at the time of sending. Whichever public address is showing on the public address field, will be the current active address on the wallet. Other addresses can be activated by clicking on the drop-down menu and clicking on it.

### 8. I Imported my key and I do not see my RBX coin balance. How do I fix this?

> When you import a key, the funds should show within a block of importing. If the balance has not shown, please make sure you are up to the network block height and the wallet is not hidden on the manage wallets menu.

### 9. Where can I see if a transaction has been successfully finalized?

> All transactions on the wallet will finalize upon a green “success” message showing on the recent transaction list on the front of the wallet or on the wallet transaction page.

### 10. How do I delete my key and address?

> The RBX wallet can only be hidden or uninstalled from your machine. Please remember that if the uninstall process includes the deletion of your database files, upon resync, you will not see or be able to access your account unless the key is once again imported, but the key is never truly deleted. It is very important to always safely store multiple copies of your private key and public address as a backup!

### 11. How do I Hide/Show my RBX Wallet Balance?

> Wallets can be hidden by clicking on the drop-down menu next to the public address and clicking on the manage wallet button. The footer will rise from the bottom of the wallet and the wallet/s list will show a red Hide Button button on the right-hand side of the pop-up screen.

### 12. Where can I check the version of the wallet I currently have?

> The wallet version can be seen on the center bottom of the GUI wallet and the CLI version can be seen on the Status box in the front of the wallet.

### 13. How will I know when a new wallet version is released?

> The best way to stay up with any network update is to refer to the RBX discord to stay connected with all community posts and announcements related to the network. The most recent wallet version will also be accessible via the Core Wallet Download button on the reserveblock.io site.

### 14. What is the purpose of creating an RBX domain name?

> It creates an alias for your wallet’s address that can also be used to receive funds and/or transactions, as well as using as the public address to send an NFT.

### 15. How do I add or remove an RBX domain name?

> Go to the RBX domain tab on the front of the wallet and create or delete your RBX domain name.

### 16. How many RBX domain names can I create per wallet?

> You can only create one RBX domain name per address if the address has sufficient funds to register the domain name, which is 1 RBX and immediately burned on the transaction.

### 17. Can I use my RBX domain name to receive transactions on my RBX wallet?

> Yes, the created alias can be used as the address for sending or receiving. For example, instead of sending to the public address `xXkPf2mrU94LtqpU3WtpBZTenFPNnXXX`, you can send the transaction to the created RBX domain name which may be `block123`, in this case, you will send the transaction to `block123.rbx`. Please note, all the characters must be lowercase when using the RBX domain names, to send or receive.

### 18. What does the Validator Voting feature allow me to do on my wallet?

> The feature allows current validators to propose and/or vote on active topics on the network for improvements, changes, among others and is where all governance of the network occurs by peers.

### 19. What are the requirements to submit a topic for voting on my RBX wallet?

> The user must be actively validating with a minimum of one block reward awarded to be eligible to post a topic, or else the wallet will produce an error upon topic creation. But you are allowed to vote on active topics without a reward if you are an active validator. Submitting a topic proposal is a cost of 1 RBX to the peer that is submitting and is burned immediately on the transaction.

### 20. How do I encrypt my RBX wallet?

> To encrypt your wallet, click on the “encrypt wallet” tab on the general tools section of the wallet. Please remember to back up your newly created password, as this will be needed to start up your wallet and needed to access any function.

### 21. What is the difference between encrypting the wallet and creating an HD wallet?

> When a user encrypts the wallet, a password is created and needed to enter or to perform any current or future transactions on the wallet upon startup. A hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet will generate randomly generated words, known as a mnemonic recovery phrase, that are used to generate all the private keys for the wallet. The recovery phrase must be kept safe by the user, as they will provide a backup in the case of lost or forgotten private keys.

### 22. What is the difference between a “Created Beacon” and a “Remote Beacon”?

> When a user creates a beacon, the wallet will participate in acting as a relay with media transfer on the RBX network, however it is not required, and a user may send media to any peer without having their own beacon at all. Adding a remote beacon is for any user who wishes to add a known beacon they prefer to serve as their relay when receiving media, which again is not a requirement when receiving, this is only a preference.
